// on the device authorizing the action.
//
// Users may be referenced by user name, or as a group with a group name.
// Groups are defined and managed in the authorization policy itself.
//
// Paths may be referenced in whole or in complete parts, ie:
//   /interfaces/interface[name=Ethernet1/2/3]/state/counters
//   /interfaces/interface[name=*]/state/oper-status
//   /network-instances/network-instance/tables/table[proto=BGP][family=*]
//
// Paths are gnmi.Path protobufs.
//
// The most specific match is returned for a request, this means the longest
// path and the most specific user match (user preferred over group).
//
// Additionally, the policy maintains a timestamp of creation
// and version number from the underlying version control system.
// The version/timestamp are available to requestors to verify which version
// of policy is being applied at the time of the request.
