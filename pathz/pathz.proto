// The OpenConfig Path-based Authz Policy Management Service exported by
// targets.
//

// The OpenConfig Path-based Authorization Policy defines which principals
// are permitted to access which OpenConfig path.

// The service allows for installation of a policy using the Install() RPC and
// then to change/update it using the Rotate() RPC.
// There can be multiple polices installed on a target of which only one is
// active and the rest are on-standby.
// Activation of a standby policy is not handled by this service and is done
// using the gNMI API.

  // Rotate will replace an existing OpenConfig Path-based Authz Policy on
  // the target.
  // If the stream is broken or any of the steps fail the target must rollback
  // to the original state, i.e. revert any changes to the OpenConfig Path-based
  // Authz Policy made during this RPC.
  //
  // Note that only one such RPC can be in progress. An attempt to call this
  // RPC while another is already in progress will be rejected with the
  // `UNAVAILABLE` gRPC error.
  //
  // An attempt to rotate a policy with not exisitng `id` will be rejected
  // with the `FAILED_PRECONDITION` gRPC error.
  //
  // The following describes the sequence of messages that must be exchanged
  // in the Rotate() RPC.
  //
  // Sequence of expected messages:
  //   Step 1: Start the stream
  //     Client ----> Rotate() RPC stream begin ------> Target
  //
  //   Step 2: Send OpenConfig Path-based Authz Policy to Target.
  //     Client --> UploadRequest(pathz_policy) ----> Target
  //     Client <-- UploadResponse <--- Target
  //
  //   Step 3 (optional): Test/Validation by the client.
  //     During this step client attempts to call a RPC that is allowed
  //     in the new policy and validates that the new policy "works".
  //     Additionally the client should access an OpenConfig path that is
  //     not allowed and the attempt must fail proving that the OpenConfig
  //     Path-based Authz Policy "works".
  //     Once verfied, the client then proceeds to finalize the rotation.
  //     If the new verification did not succeed the client will cancel the
  //     RPC thereby forcing the target to perform a rollback of the new
  //     OpenConfig Path-based Authz Policy.
  //
  //   Step 4: Final commit.
  //     Client ---> FinalizeRequest ----> Target
