// Define a list of policies, where the most specific policy is applied

//
// Users may be referenced by user name, or as a group with a group name.
// Groups are defined and managed in the authorization policy itself.
//
// Paths may be referenced in whole or in complete parts, ie:

// The OpenConfig gNMI Path-based Authorization Policy Management Service
// exported by targets.
//

// The OpenConfig Path-based Authorization Policy defines which principals
// are permitted to access which OpenConfig path.

// The service allows for change/update of the OpenConfig Path-based
// Authorization Policy using the Rotate() RPC.
// There can be only one OpenConfig Path-based Authorization Policy installed on
// a target.

service Pathz {

  // Rotate will replace an existing OpenConfig gNMI Path-based Authorization
  // Policy on the target.
  // If the stream is broken or any of the steps fail the target must rollback
  // to the original state, i.e. revert any changes to the OpenConfig gNMI
  // Path-based Authorization Policy made during this RPC.
  //
  // Note that only one such RPC can be in progress. An attempt to call this
  // RPC while another is already in progress will be rejected with the
  // `UNAVAILABLE` gRPC error.
  //
  // The following describes the sequence of messages that must be exchanged
  // in the Rotate() RPC.
  //
  // Sequence of expected messages:
  //   Step 1: Start the stream
  //     Client ----> Rotate() RPC stream begin ------> Target
  //
  //   Step 2: Send OpenConfig gNMI Path-based Authorization Policy to Target.
  //     Client --> UploadRequest(pathz_policy) ----> Target
  //     Client <-- UploadResponse <--- Target
  //
  //   Step 3 (optional): Test/Validation by the client.
  //     During this step client calls (possibly multiple times)
  //     the Probe(POLICY_INSTANCE_SANDBOX) RPC to check that a combination of
  //     user ID, gNMI path and operation mode that is supposed to be allowed by
  //     the new policy and validates that the response is ACTION_PERMIT.
  //     Additionally the client should call the Probe(POLICY_INSTANCE_SANDBOX)
  //     RPC with a combination of user ID, gNMI path and operation mode that is
  //     not allowed in the new policy and the attempt must result in
  //     the ACTION_DENY response proving that the new policy "works".
  //     Once verified, the client then proceeds to finalize the rotation.
  //     If the verification did not succeed the client will cancel the Rotate
  //     RPC thereby forcing the target to perform a rollback of the new
  //     OpenConfig gNMI Path-based Authorization Policy to the previous one.
  //
  //   Step 4: Final commit.
  //     Client ---> FinalizeRequest ----> Target
