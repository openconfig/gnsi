// gNMI server. This file assumes the following nomenclature:
//
//   o A System is a network device or other gN*I enabled entity creating
//     accounting Record()s.
//
//   o A remote collector which either connects to a System to retrieve
//     messages streamed in a realtime fashion, or which receives a
//     connection from a System to receive accounting Record()s.
//
// Events recorded are from shell/vendor-CLI and gRPC based connections.

// The Accounting(Pull/Push) services describe the interfaces between a System
// and a remote collector that collect data about what changes were attempted or
// completed on that System through standard interfaces to the System.
//
// Accounting messages may be collected by connecting to the Accounting
// service (AccountingPull) on a System from a remote collector, or by
// configuring a System to connect(AccountingPush) to the remote collector
// directly.
//
// Record()s created on a System can be delivered to remote collectors,
// stored locally, or discarded locally. Configuration of this behavior
// is done with standard gNMI system configuration methods.

  // received. The remote collector's expectation is that all messages
  // after the timestamp will be streamed.

  // time or a zero time. A zero time indicates that all messages stored on the
  // System should be sent to the collector. A current time indicates that only
