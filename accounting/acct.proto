//   gNxI accounting Server <-- messages -- System

// System is a router, switch, PC, ... which accepts a connection from a

// A gNMI accounting Server is a server which receives records from systems and
// logs them in the format specified using messages defined in this file.
//
// The current version covers event recording of shell/vendor-CLI and gRPC
