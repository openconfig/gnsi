//
//   o A System is a network device or other gN*I enabled entity creating
//     accounting Record()s.
//
//   o A remote collector which either connects to a System to retrieve
//     messages streamed in a realtime fashion, or which receives a
//     connection from a System to receive accounting Record()s.
//
// Events recorded are from shell/vendor-CLI and gRPC based connections.

// The Accounting(Pull/Push) services describe the interfaces between a System

// service (AccountingPull) on a System from a remote collector, or by
// configuring a System to connect(AccountingPush) to the remote collector
// directly.

// stored locally, or discarded locally. Configuration of this behavior

  // received. The remote collector's expectation is that all messages
