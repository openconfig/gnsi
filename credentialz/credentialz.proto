// This service exports two RPCs, RotateAccountCredentials() and
// RotateHostCredentials(), which are used to manage the account-related SSH
// credentials, and the host-related SSH credentials on a target respectively.
//
// Note that for the sake of data consistency and API simplicity, only one RPC
// may be in progress at a time. An attempt to initiate any of the RPCs while
// another one is already in progress will be rejected with an error.
// For example, when the RotateAccountCredentials() RPC is in progress another
// call to the RotateAccountCredentials() or the RotateHostCredentials() RPC
// will be rejected.
