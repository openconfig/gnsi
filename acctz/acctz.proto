//
//   o A remote Collector which either connects to a System to retrieve
//     messages streamed in a realtime fashion, or which receives a
//     connection from a System to receive accounting Record()s.
//
// Events recorded are from shell/vendor-CLI and gRPC based connections.

// The gRPC-level Accounting service exported by targets.

// The Accounting service describes the interfaces between a System
// and a remote Collector that collect data about what changes were attempted
// or completed on that System through standard interfaces to the System.
//
// Accounting messages may be collected by connecting to the Accounting
// service (Acctz) on a System from a Collector.

service Acctz {

  // RecordSubscribe returns a stream of Record()s sent from the system to
  // a Collector, when the Collector connects to the Acctz service.
  //
  // A RecordRequest contains a timestamp indicating the last message
  // received. The Collector's expectation is that all messages after the
  // timestamp will be streamed.  If this results in no records to send, the
  // server should return an OK error and zero records.
  //
  // Any history for replay of records or size of the history is subject to
  // implementation support and may or may not be configurable.  The history
  // should be global to the device or virtual tenant, such that new and
  // re-connecting clients can access the history.
  //
  // At connection initiation the Collector may send either the current
  // time or a zero time. A zero time indicates that all messages stored on the
  // System should be sent to the Collector. A current time indicates that only
  // new messages should be sent.
  //
  // The Collector must send a RecordRequest at least every 60 seconds, in
  // order to signal its liveliness to the system. Failure to send a
  // RecordRequest for more than 120 seconds will cause the connection to be
  // reset.
