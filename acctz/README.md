# gNSI Accounting Protocol

## Objective

This proto definition serves to describe a method of transfering
accounting records from a System, which may be a network device, to a
remote collection service, primarily over a gRPC transport connection.

## Method of Operation

Accounting Records are available at a gNSI origin:
   gnsi.accounting

Records may be streamed from a system either at request of the remote
collector, via the AccountingPull() service/rpc, or at the request of
the system to a remote collector, via the AccountingPush() service/rpc.

Configuration of the Accounting service is made through standard
gNxI methods using the defined YANG model.

Records will be streamed to the receiver as individual Record
messages as they are defined in the gnsi.accounting protocol buffer
definition.

Each Record() message contains a timestamp element, this represents the
time at which the accounted event occured, local to the system which sends
the message. This could be different from the time received at the distant
end, and the time the Record was emitted from the system.

Each stream method requires that acknowledgements be sent periodically
in order to signal both which messages have been successfully processed
and that the remote collector has not lost state relative to the connection.
