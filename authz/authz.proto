// The gRPC-level Authorization Policy Management Service exported by targets.
//

// Authorization Policy defines which principals are permitted to access which
// resource. Resources are individual RPC methods scoped by services.

// Example policy:
//
// {
//     "name": "gNSI.ssh policy",
//     "allow_rules": [{
//         "name": "admin-access",
//         "principals": [
//             "spiffe://company.com/sa/alice",
//             "spiffe://company.com/sa/bob"
//         ],
//         "request": {
//             "paths": [
//                 "/gnsi.ssh.Ssh/MutateAccountCredentials",
//                 "/gnsi.ssh.Ssh/MutateHostCredentials"
//             ]
//         }
//     }]
// }
//
// This example would authorize "alice" and "bob" to call
// "MutateHostCredentials" and "MutateAccountCredentials" of "gnsi.ssh.Ssh"
// service.

  // Rotate will replace an existing gRPC-level Authorization Policy on the
  // target.
  //
  // If the stream is broken or any of the steps fail the
  // target must rollback to the original state, i.e. revert any changes to
  // the gRPC-level Authorization Policy made during this RPC.
  //
  // Note that only one such RPC can be in progress. An attempt to call this
  // RPC while another is already in progress will be rejected with the
  // `UNAVAILABLE` gRPC error.
  //
  // The following describes the sequence of messages that must be exchanged
  // in the Rotate() RPC.
  //
  // Sequence of expected messages:
  //   Step 1: Start the stream
  //     Client ----> Rotate() RPC stream begin ------> Target
  //
  //   Step 2: Send gRPC-level Authorization Policy to Target.
  //     Client --> UploadRequest(authz_policy) ----> Target
  //     Client <-- UploadResponse <--- Target
  //
  //   Step 3 (optional): Test/Validation by the client.
  //     During this step client attempts to call a RPC that is allowed
  //     in the new policy and validates that the new policy "works".
  //     Additionally the client should call a RPC that is not allowed and
  //     the attempt must fail proving that the gRPC-level Authorization Policy
  //     "works".
  //     Once verified, the client then proceeds to finalize the rotation.
  //     If the new verification did not succeed the client will cancel the
  //     RPC thereby forcing the target to rollback of the new gRPC-level
  //     Authorization Policy.
  //
  //   Step 4: Final commit.
  //     Client ---> FinalizeRequest ----> Target
